            <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                <p>Now more than in generations past young adults are finding themselves in a challenging economy that makes what once were attainable goals like financial stability and home ownership nearly impossible. With more than 50% of young adults not receiving financial advice from parents and guardians at home(Prime Capital, 2024) they are left uninformed and without strategic financial skills. One of the biggest skills that is lacking is "money-management behaviors"(Forrest, 2018). Many young adults aren't keeping a close eye on how much they are spending and on what. For that reason, we believe it is critical for young adults to learn how to keep a budget and develop a better understanding of their finances.</p>

            <h2>What tools did we use?</h2>
                <h4>Adobe Express:</h4>
                    <p> Throughout our design process we have been using Adobe Express to house an Express Website that has acted as a place where we can plan and consolidate our findings in one place.</p>
                <h4>Miro</h4>
                    <p>Miro is a digital workspace where users can fleshout their ideas. We used it to digitize our sticky notes during the ideation phase, you can find more information about that below.</p>
                <h4>Canva</h4>
                    <p>I used canva a few times throughout this project as a quick and easy alternative to something like Adobe Photoshop. It was a logical alternative for myself as I have used it in the past and it allowed me to have a smooth workflow without getting hung up on having to figure out how to use other software.</p>
                <h4 >Google Sheets</h4>
                    <img class="rightImage" src="../images/googleSheetsGraph.png" alt="Pie Chart Generated With Google Sheets">
                    <p class="rightImageText">I used Google sheets to process the data and produce graphs to help to visualize it. From that we learned that we were able to glean a lot more from our interview pool.  </p>
                <h4>Adobe XD</h4>
                    <p>I used Adobe XD and their library of UI assests to create a high high-fidelity prototype of our application.</p>

            <h2>Discovery Phases:</h2>
                <h3>Empathize</h3>
                <img class="leftImage" src="../images/empathyMapPicture.png" alt="Empathy Map">
                <p class="">The Empathize phase was all about finding our target demographic and learning more about their needs. We interviewed five participants and asked them a variety of questions about their budgeting habits, experiences and pit-falls. It was interesting because we had to really put ourselves in the shoes of our interviewees. It's not that we were supposed to feel bad for their issues but rather to really understand what they are feeling and what that part of their life is like.</p>
                <br>
                <hr class="subHr">
                <br>
                <h3 >Define</h3>
                <img class="rightImage" src="../images/persona.png" alt="Persona Image">
                <p class="rightImageText" class="textSpacer">The purpose of the Define phase was to take everything we learned from our interviewees and look for commonalities or things that stuck out. We then distilled that into what is called a persona. A persona is a fictional person that you create to represent the needs and experiences of your interviewees. By having this persona you can rule out what isn't going to be as important to your end-users and then focus on what is going to be most useful.</p>
                <hr class="subHr">
                <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <img class="leftImage" src="../images/ideation.png" alt="">
                <p class="leftImageText">The next part of our process was generating ideas. We used the Walt Disney creative strategy to serve as our ideation framework. There are three stages to the Walt Disney creative strategy, the dreamer, the realist and the critic. For the dreamer stage we generated many ideas with total an unbridled freedom this gave us our foundation of what our application would need to include. The realist stage allowed us to think a little bit more about how each of the ideas from the dreamer stage would work and look. Thats not to say we were worried about actual implementation yet it was more about getting specific about what the user would see and how they would interact with the feature. The critic stage  was about finding the holes in our ideas, I thought of this as not attacking the ideas we previously generated but more of a quality control of the potential features. </p>
                <hr class="subHr">
                <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                <p class="rightImageText">This stage was very exciting and is where a lot of our previous work started to pay off. My partner and I first took a look at our ideas from the ideation step and refreshed ourselved. We then did some rough sketches of what our UI could look like seperately. We then came back together and explained our sketches to each other. We discussed what we did and did not like about eachothers sketches. We then combined those ideas that we felt worked into another rough sketch. That final rough sketch served as the inspiration for our high-fidelity prototype. </p>
