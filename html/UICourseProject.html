            <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                <p>Now more than in generations past young adults are finding themselves in a challenging economy that makes what once were attainable goals like financial stability and home ownership nearly impossible. With more than 50% of young adults not receiving financial advice from parents and guardians at home(Prime Capital, 2024) they are left uninformed and without strategic financial skills. One of the biggest skills that is lacking is "money-management behaviors"(Forrest, 2018). Many young adults aren't keeping a close eye on how much they are spending and on what. For that reason, we believe it is critical for young adults to learn how to keep a budget and develop a better understanding of their finances.</p>        
            
            <h2>What tools did we use?</h2>
                <h4>Adobe Express:</h4>
                    <p> Throughout our design process we have been using Adobe Express to house an Express Website that has acted as a place where we can plan and consolidate our findings in one place.</p>
                <h4>Miro</h4>
                    <p>Miro is a digital workspace where users can fleshout their ideas. We used it to digitize our sticky notes during the ideation phase, you can find more information about that below.</p>
                <h4>Canva</h4>
                    <p>I used canva a few times throughout this project as a quick and easy alternative to something like Adobe Photoshop. It was a logical alternative for myself as I have used it in the past and it allowed me to have a smooth workflow without getting hung up on having to figure out how to use other software./p>
                <h4>Google Sheets</h4>
                    <p>I used Google </p>

            <h2>Discovery Phases:</h2>

                <h3>Ideation</h3>
