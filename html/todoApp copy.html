            <h1>Hypermedia TODO App</h1>
        
            <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                <p>A problem with modern web development is that people often reach directly for JavaScript frameworks, like Angular and React to create their web apps rather than considering if a hypermedia application would be a better way to build their app. The purpose of this project was to show how a hypermedia approach can be used  to create a competent and fully functional web app with a quality user experience.</p>        
            <hr>
            <h2>What tools did we use?</h2>
                <h3>Front End</h3>

                    <h4>Html:</h4>
                    <p>Since we are using a hypermedia approach our application was formatted in HTML </p>

                    <h4>Pico CSS:</h4>
                    <p>We used the CSS library Pico CSS to give us a functional and aesthetic layout. We did in a few instances write some styles to style elements for our applications needs</p>

                    <h4>HTMX:</h4>
                    <div class="imageContainer">
                        <img class="todoImage" src="../images/HTMX.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>HTMX is a JavaScript library that allows more hypermedia controls to be injected into HTML. It gave us as developers the power to add lots of functionality and quality-of-life improvements without large JavaScript frameworks.</p>

                    <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                    <p>Although the point of this project was to show how a hypermedia approach can be used to build powerful web apps there were some instances where we used snippets of JavaScript to add some functionality.</p>
                <hr class="subHr">
                <h3>Back End</h3>
                    <h4>Python:</h4>
                    <p>We used Python as the language that all of our backend code is written in.</p>
                    <h4>Flask:</h4>
                    <p>We used the Python library Flask to be our webserver, this was my second time using Flask and I feel that it is one of the best approaches to get a webserver up and running in Python. It is intuitive and easy to use by handling your routing for you.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Jinja2</h4>
                    <p>Jinja is an HTML templating language that feels like an obvious option for our needs in this project it perfectly bridges the gap between HTML and Python. By giving us the ability to have dynamically generated HTML our app's functionality and user experience was greatly improved.</p>
                    
                    <h4>PeeWee ORM with SQLite:</h4>
                    <div class="imageContainer">
                        <img class="todoImage" src="../images/DB.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>PeeWee is an object-relational model that allowed us to connect our backend to a SQLite database. Its syntax was easy to learn and doesn't feel too far off from writing SQL directly in Python but it gives you a few helpful guardrails.</p>

            <h2>Our Development Process:</h2>
                <p>The first portion of our development was done together as a class. After that portion of the development was done we split off into groups and spent time brainstorming features that would improve the user experience. We then separately implemented features that improved the user experience by providing more features and security.</p>
                <h3>Web 1.0:</h3>
                <div class="imageContainer">
                    <img class="todoImage" src="../images/reorder.png" alt="">
                </div>
                
                <p>The first iteration of our application was developed with a Web 1.0 mindset. That meant most of our interaction with the user was occurring via forms issuing POST and GET requests. We began by outlining what our app was going to need to do. We took this and built the initial layout and functionality. After that was completed we implemented a connection to our database via PeeWee, this required us to reimplement the way our data model was designed but the trade-off was definitely worth it. The ability to have our TODOs persist past memory was highly valuable by speeding up our development process.</p>
                <h3>Adding HTMX</h3>
                <p>The addition of HTMX to our application added lots of small quality-of-life changes that made the user experience smoother. These changes allowed the application to update the page while maintaining the scroll state. This included toggling the completeness of TODOs, reordering of TODOs, and active search that updated results as a user-provided input.</p>
                <h3>Expanding Functionality</h3>
                <p>My group had three members and we each decided on a feature or an area of the user experience that we wanted to improve. We decided on application security, adding the ability to have multiple users, and adding information onto a user's TODO.</p>
                <p>For security, we implemented HTML escaping to prevent XSS(Cross-Site Scripting) attacks. This user input sanitization can give users a better piece of mind that their information is secure within our system. We also implemented feedback to the user, if a user tries to bypass the required attribute in the HTML and enter an invalid TODO with missing information they are given a notification window indicating what error occurred.</p>                    
                    <div class="imageContainer">
                        <img class="todoImage" src="../images/login.png" alt="">
                    </div>
                    <p>The addition of multiple users in our system may seem obvious but our first iteration needed to be functioning how we intended before we expanded to adding this feature. This feature allows our application to be much more powerful. A user can create a username and password that they can use on their subsequent visits to our site to access their TODOs. This change required some changes to our database by giving a todo a userID which is associated with a user and filtering all TODOs based on that ID.</p>
                    <p>We added a few more pieces of information to the TODOs including an optional due date. This allows our application to give the user more flexibility and sort their TODOs by the due date. For TODOs that are past due they appear at the top of the list of TODOs with some styling to give a notification to the user.                    </p>
                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>One of the best things about this project was the freedom we had to develop our project. Since we had spent some time defining our goals we had a clear vision of what user experience improvements needed to be made. Once we had each implemented our respective features we presented them to one another explaining how we implemented each feature. We then tested one another's features to ensure robust functionality. Overall, I'm proud of where we are at on this project. We created an application with a solid user experience using the design principles we have learned.
